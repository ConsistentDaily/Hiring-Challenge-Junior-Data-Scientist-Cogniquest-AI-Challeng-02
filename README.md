Challenge 2 | Resume Matching Using NLP

Objective:



Create a Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based system to effectively match candidate resumes with the most suitable job postings. This system aims to streamline the recruitment process by automating the assessment of candidate-job fit, enhancing both efficiency and accuracy in talent acquisition. 



Description:



Matching resumes to job postings involves analyzing and understanding the textual content of both candidates' resumes and job descriptions. Your task is to develop an intelligent system that evaluates compatibility based on skills, experience, qualifications, and other pertinent factors, thereby facilitating optimal pairing between candidates and job opportunities.
