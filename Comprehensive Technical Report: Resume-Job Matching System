3. Implementation Details
3.1 Data Structures
```python
Resume Format:
{
    "candidate_id": string,
    "name": string,
    "summary": string,
    "experience": List[Dict],
    "education": Dict,
    "skills": List[string]
}

Job Format:
{
    "job_id": string,
    "title": string,
    "company": string,
    "required_skills": List[string],
    "preferred_skills": List[string],
    "job_description": string,
    "responsibilities": List[string]
}
```
